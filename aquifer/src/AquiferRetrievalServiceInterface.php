 ** We are pretending that there is some third-party service that we can     **

 ** data we want for our methods is not important. One of the benefits of    **
 ** defining an interface is that it lays out the rules of what we want,     **
 ** independent of what exists. The complexity of changing what exists into  **
 ** what we want will be hidden inside of the class that implements the      **
 ** interface.                                                               **
